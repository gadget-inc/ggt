Require Node 18 or later

## `ggt` requires Node 18 or later to run

Node 16 reached End-of-Life (EOL) on 2023-09-11:

- https://github.com/nodejs/release#end-of-life-releases
- https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol

This means Node 16 no longer receives security updates and bug fixes.

ggt runs on your computer, so it's important to use a supported version of Node to ensure you have the latest security updates. **Your Gadget environment will continue to use the Node version specified in your [Framework version](https://docs.gadget.dev/guides/gadget-framework).**
