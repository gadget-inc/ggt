# @gadgetinc/ggt

## 1.7.4

### Patch Changes

- 4089900: Make `ggt push` retry "Files version mismatch" errors when possible.

## 1.7.3

### Patch Changes

- 1b5d93e: Added `.shopify` to the list of always ignored files. It is a local only folder and doesn't need to be synced with your Gadget environment.

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- 5da096a: Add `unref` to the session update interval to allow the process to exit.

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- f7076b3: Automatically refresh the authentication session to avoid expiration.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- ca8964b: Add a logs command to stream logs from any environment

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 3bf13cb: Misc fixes from telemetry data, specifically including fixes for two bugs where expected app behavior can wrongly display an unexpected error.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 1171831: Add a mechanism for configuring default options when running ggt commands.

## 1.5.1

### Patch Changes

- ca25131: Restrict SSL/TLS to require TLSv1.1 or better. SSLv3 will no longer be supported.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bf2df7: New `ggt add env` command has been added to allow for environment creation.

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- a42ba35: Enable `keepAlive` in the graphql-ws client to keep the connection alive.

  Users have pointed out that `ggt dev` stops receiving file updates sometimes after their computer has gone to sleep.

  This fixes that issue by enabling the `keepAlive` option in the graphql-ws client. This makes the client send a ping every few seconds to the server to ensure the connection is still alive. Luckily for us, we've already implemented the pong handler on our servers because we use this same pattern in our editor!

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- e3fe0bb: Don't automatically enable source maps

  We introduced `--enable-source-maps` in v1.4.0 using the following shebang:

  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env -S node --enable-source-maps
  ```

  This change was made so that source maps would be enabled by default when running `ggt`, giving Gadget employees more information when `ggt` crashes. However, this has caused some issues with certain environments (e.g. `'-S' is not recognized as an internal or external command`), so we are reverting this change and will go back to the following shebang:

  ```
  #!/usr/bin/env node
  ```

  If you are running `ggt` and want source maps enabled, you can still do so by running `ggt` with the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable set to `--enable-source-maps`:

  ```
  NODE_OPTIONS='--enable-source-maps' ggt
  ```

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- fcb272f: Add more `--env` aliases.

  - `ggt pull` now accepts `--from` as an alias for `--env`
  - `ggt push` now accepts `--to` as an alias for `--env`

- 7da5de8: Allow `ggt pull --from=production` to pull files from your production environment.

### Patch Changes

- 3f9b60d: Attempt to fix `Error: dest already exists.` by moving files one at a time to `.gadget/backup/`.
- 9aa8657: Enable source maps for better error messages and debugging.

## 1.3.3

### Patch Changes

- da25b70: Fix the following assertion error from occurring:

  ```
  An error occurred while communicating with Gadget

  '' == true

  If you think this is a bug, click here to create an issue on GitHub.
  ```

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 11eca08: Fix `ggt pull --force` still asking for confirmation.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- c7cc65e: Make `ggt deploy --force` skip asking for confirmation to push.

  `ggt deploy --force` implies that you want to discard any existing changes on the environment you are deploying from, so it should not ask for confirmation to push.

- b3752b6: Fix `ggt push --force` still asking for confirmation.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 04fcce2: `ggt dev` now outputs application logs!

  In our push to make your local development experience as streamlined as possible, we've now included application logs, by default, to output during a sync session!

  ![CleanShot 2024-10-02 at 16 04 03@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/840c23fd-8532-4b99-ad30-e0bb936afc10)

  Not only that, as long as your terminal supports linking, traceID(s) are also setup to take you to the editor logs!

  ![CleanShot 2024-10-02 at 16 10 53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5e2b172-c7a7-43b3-b329-d84600f9f8ab)

  No worries if the verbose output isn't your thing, we've got you covered:

  - `--no-logs` - completely turns off this new feature
  - `--my-logs` - same as the editor logs boolean for only showing my logs/events
  - `--log-level` - Set the log level for incoming application logs, `debug, info, error`

  As always any more info can be found through `ggt dev --help`!

### Patch Changes

- 38210c3: Never ignore `.gadget/` directory

  ggt no longer ignores the `.gadget/` directory when it is listed in the `.ignore` file. The `.gadget/` directory is managed by ggt and ignoring it causes issues like infinite sync loops.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 05cc186: `ggt deploy` will now show a deleted data warning when pushing changes to production that would cause data loss.

  <img width="654" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b45cc7-54fb-480e-ad73-2d80fea3d4eb">

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 87875c9: Dropped support for downgrading to ggt v0.4.x

  ggt v1.1.x will no longer output a `.gadget/sync.json` file that is compatible with ggt v0.4.x. This means local directories that are synced with ggt v1.1.x will no longer be able to be synced with ggt v0.4.x. This change was made to simplify and reduce the complexity of the codebase.

### Patch Changes

- e83ea58: Updated app select to show apps grouped by team!

  ![CleanShot 2024-08-30 at 17 44 39@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca15c319-77a9-4c8b-a6a9-5eef55a72869)

- 8d8d922: New command! `ggt add`

  The `ggt add` command enables you to conveniently add a model, action, or route to your gadget project directly from your local development environment.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 0327764: Fix `Unexpected server response: 404`

  ggt was always using the `--development` url when subscribing to Gadget's GraphQL API. This was fine if your app had an environment named `development`, but would fail with a 404 if your app didn't have an environment named `development`.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- ccf9e4d: Bump simple-git from 3.22.0 to 3.23.0
- 0944809: Bump @sentry/node from 7.106.1 to 7.107.0
- 8c9672f: Bump mimic-function from 5.0.0 to 5.0.1
- 50af8a5: Bump @sentry/node from 7.106.0 to 7.106.1
- e1abd14: Cleanup empty directories.

  We've improved how `ggt` calculates which empty directories need to be removed. This should result in fewer empty directories being left behind while running `ggt dev`.

- b838cd3: Bump get-port from 7.0.0 to 7.1.0
- 2bedcf2: Bump @swc/helpers from 0.5.6 to 0.5.7
- e3d3ca6: Handle existing files in the `.gadget/backup/` directory.

  When `ggt` needs to backup a file that already exists in the `.gadget/backup/` directory, it will now remove the existing file before creating the backup. This should prevent the following error from occurring:

  ```
  Error: ENOTDIR: not a directory, lstat '.gadget/backup/routes/webhooks/POST-github.js'
  ```

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- c420a54: Require Node 18 or later

  ## `ggt` requires Node 18 or later to run

  Node 16 reached End-of-Life (EOL) on 2023-09-11:

  - https://github.com/nodejs/release#end-of-life-releases
  - https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol

  This means Node 16 no longer receives security updates and bug fixes.

  ggt runs on your computer, so it's important to use a supported version of Node to ensure you have the latest security updates. **Your Gadget environment will continue to use the Node version specified in your [Framework version](https://docs.gadget.dev/guides/gadget-framework).**

- 91de55b: Release v1.0.0

  ## `ggt` v1.0.0 is here!

  We're excited to announce the release of `ggt` v1.0.0! This release is the culmination of months of hard work and includes a bunch of new commands to take advantage of Gadget's v1 launch week 👀

  Let's take a look at what's new:

  ### `ggt dev`

  `ggt dev` replaces `ggt sync` and is the new and improved way to develop your Gadget app locally. It comes with a fresh new look and feel, making sure you always know which environment and git branch you're developing on.

  That's right, `ggt dev` is git and multi-environment aware, and comes with a new `--env` flag to change which environment you're developing on.

  ![ggt dev example](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/assets/21965521/88413d2c-b00a-4a06-8493-96d7f8cceb8f)

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > `ggt sync` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. From now on, if you run `ggt sync`, `ggt dev` will be run instead.

  ### `ggt status`

  Now that you can develop on multiple environments, it's important to know which environment you're currently developing on. That's where `ggt status` comes in. It shows you the current environment and git branch you're developing on, as well as the status of your local files compared to your environment's files.

  ![ggt status example](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/assets/21965521/4590af24-59c1-40ed-a2f4-8dfd05c603a6)

  ### `ggt push` and `ggt pull`

  When you need to push your local files to your environment, or pull your environment's files to your local machine without having ggt
  continue to watch for changes, you can use `ggt push` and `ggt pull` respectively.

  `ggt push` and `ggt pull` are also environment aware, so you can use the `--env` flag to specify which environment you want to push or pull from.

  ![ggt push example](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/assets/21965521/e7f739a9-e944-41d0-8563-d7a70af8cc2e)

  ### `ggt deploy`

  Once you're ready to deploy your environment to production, you can use `ggt deploy`. This command will ensure your environment's files are up to date with your local files, and then deploy your environment to production 🎉

  ![ggt deploy example](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/assets/21965521/3298ca86-8882-461e-bb9a-aef8cf7661ad)

  ### `ggt open`

  Finally, we've added `ggt open` to quickly open your Gadget app in your default browser. Run `ggt open --help` to see all the places you can open your browser to.

  ![ggt open example](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/assets/21965521/9af3cde8-0faa-4b75-9866-f239911950fc)

  ### This is just the beginning

  Even though `ggt` v1.0.0 is here, we're not done yet. We have a lot of exciting features and improvements planned for the future. Don't be surprised to see a few v1.0.x releases in the coming days as we iron out any kinks the community finds 😅

  We hope you enjoy the new `ggt` commands and the new `ggt dev` experience. We're excited to see what you build with Gadget v1!

- b55345e: ggt can now recover from "Files version mismatch" errors! 🎉

  Gadget has a concept of a "files version" which keeps track of the state of your Gadget environment's files. Every time your files change, Gadget increments your files version.

  When ggt sends files to Gadget, it also sends along the files version it expects Gadget to be at. If Gadget's files version matches the one ggt sent, then Gadget will accept the changes and increment its files version. If Gadget's files version doesn't match the one ggt sent, then Gadget will refuse the changes and send back a "Files version mismatch" error like this:

  ```
  Gadget responded with the following error:

    Files version mismatch, expected 67 but got 68
  ```

  There are 2 common causes for this error:

  - You make a change that causes Gadget to generate files and you don't receive those files before sending more changes to Gadget.
  - Multiple people are syncing at the same time and one person sends changes to Gadget before receiving another persons changes.

  Before, ggt didn't have a reliable way to detect and resolve de-syncs so it would crash and force you to restart 😞

  However, now that [we've improved ggt's de-sync detection](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/releases/tag/v0.4.0), it can automatically recover from "Files version mismatch" errors by re-syncing and continuing to watch for changes like normal!

  If the changes that caused the "Files version mismatch" error are conflicting, then ggt will prompt you to choose which changes to keep before continuing to watch for more changes, the same way it does when you first start syncing. If you always want to keep your local changes during a "Files version mismatch" error, you can use the `--prefer=local` flag.

  We hope this makes your development experience with Gadget more enjoyable.

  Happy Holidays! 🎄🎁

- 3ef4c57: Retry errors when sending files to Gadget

## 0.4.6

### Patch Changes

- 03938ae: Disabled file permission syncing

  We have temporarily disabled the ability to sync file permissions between your local filesystem and your Gadget environment. This is due to a bug that is causing permissions not to be set correctly when changed via `ggt sync`. We have created a ticket to track this issue and will re-enable this feature once it is resolved.

  In the meantime, if you need to change a file's permissions in your Gadget environment, you can do so by opening the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS) and running `chmod` on the file directly.

  Here's an example of how to change the permissions on a file named `test.sh` to be executable:

  ![CleanShot 2023-12-18 at 17 58 10@2x](https://github.com/gadget-inc/ggt/assets/21965521/13f06911-6abe-4ee5-ad63-0446ba65b62f)

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 770beb1: We made some improvements to our debug logs!

  Previously, we were using the `debug` package to log messages. This was good at first, but now that we're adding more features to `ggt` we need more control over our logs. We want to be able to output structured logs, control the verbosity, and output them as JSON so that we can pipe them to another tool or parse them in a script.

  To accomplish this, we've added 2 new flags:

  - `-v, --verbose` to output structured logs

    This replaces the `--debug` flag, which was a boolean flag that would print out all logs. This new flag is a counter, so you can use it multiple times to increase the verbosity of the logs. Currently, there are 3 levels of verbosity:

    - `-v` = INFO
    - `-vv` = DEBUG
    - `-vvv` = TRACE

  - `--json` to print out logs in JSON format

    This is useful if you want to pipe the logs to another tool, or if you want to parse the logs in a script.

- 346dfa6: Improvements to `ggt sync`!

  ### Improved de-sync detection and conflict resolution:

  `ggt sync` can now detect all discrepancies between your local filesystem and your Gadget environment's filesystem. Previously, if a file was deleted locally while `ggt sync` was not running, `ggt sync` could not detect that the file was deleted and would not delete the file in your Gadget environment.

  Now, `ggt sync` can detect the following discrepancies:

  - Files that exist locally but not in your Gadget environment
  - Files that exist in your Gadget environment but not locally
  - Files that exist locally and in your Gadget environment but have different contents
  - Files that exist locally and in your Gadget environment but have different permissions
    - Only supported when the local filesystem is macOS or Linux

  When `ggt sync` starts, it will compare your local filesystem to your Gadget environment's filesystem and calculate the changes that have occurred since the last time `ggt sync` was run.

  You will be prompted to resolve conflicts if:

  - Both filesystems updated the same file with different contents
  - One filesystem updated a file and the other deleted it

  Otherwise, `ggt sync` will automatically merge the changes from both filesystems and begin watching for changes.

  With the new de-sync detection in place, we now _have the technology_ to solve the dreaded "Files version mismatch" error that causes `ggt sync` to crash so often. Be on the lookout for a fix to this error in the near future! 👀

  ### New `--prefer` flag:

  `ggt sync` has a new `--prefer` flag that will resolve conflicts in favor of the specified filesystem. This is useful if you always want to resolve conflicts in favor of your local filesystem or your Gadget environment's filesystem.

  ```sh
  # keep your local filesystem's conflicting changes
  $ ggt sync --prefer=local

  # keep your Gadget environment's conflicting changes
  $ ggt sync --prefer=gadget
  ```

  ### New `--once` flag:

  `ggt sync` has a new `--once` flag that will only sync local filesystem once and then exit. This flag in combination with `--prefer` is useful if you want to run `ggt sync` in a script or CI/CD pipeline and ensure that the sync will not hang waiting for user input.

  ```sh
  $ ggt sync --once --prefer=local
  ```

- 7dd74be: We got the `ggt` npm package name! 🎉

  Gadget now owns the `ggt` package on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ggt)! This means you can turn this:

  ```sh
  $ npx @gadgetinc/ggt@latest sync ~/gadget/example --app=example
  ```

  Into this:

  ```sh
  $ npx ggt@latest sync ~/gadget/example --app=example
  ```

  If you've already installed `@gadgetinc/ggt` globally, you'll need to uninstall it first:

  ```sh
  $ npm uninstall -g @gadgetinc/ggt
  # or
  $ yarn global remove @gadgetinc/ggt
  ```

  Then you can install the `ggt` package:

  ```sh
  $ npm install -g ggt@latest
  # or
  $ yarn global add ggt@latest
  ```

  It's a small change, but it's less typing and easier to remember. We hope you enjoy it!

  We're going to keep the `@gadgetinc/ggt` package up-to-date with the `ggt` package, so you can continue to use `@gadgetinc/ggt` if you prefer. We'll let you know if we ever decide to deprecate `@gadgetinc/ggt`.
