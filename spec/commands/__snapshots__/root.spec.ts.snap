"Deploy your Gadget application's development source code to production.

USAGE
  ggt deploy [DIRECTORY] [--app=<name>]

ARGUMENTS
  DIRECTORY         The directory to sync files to and deploy (default: \\".\\")

FLAGS
  -a, --app=<name>  The Gadget application to deploy
      --force       Deploy the Gadget application regardless of any issues it may have

DESCRIPTION
  Deploy allows you to deploy your current Gadget application in development to production.

  It detects if local files are up to date with remote and if the Gadget application
  is in a deployable state. If there are any issues, it will display them and ask if
  you would like to deploy anyways.

  Note:
    • If local files are not up to date or have not recently been synced with remote ones,
      you will be prompted to run a one-time sync to ensure the files remain consistent with
      what is on the remote.
    • You may wish to keep ggt sync running in the background before trying to run ggt deploy

EXAMPLE
  $ ggt deploy ~/gadget/example --app example

"Sync your Gadget environment's source code with your local filesystem.

USAGE
  ggt sync [DIRECTORY]

ARGUMENTS
  DIRECTORY                  The directory to sync files to (default: \\".\\")

FLAGS
  -a, --app=<name>           The Gadget application to sync files to
      --prefer=<filesystem>  Prefer \\"local\\" or \\"gadget\\" conflicting changes
      --once                 Sync once and exit
      --force                Sync regardless of local filesystem state

DESCRIPTION
  Sync allows you to synchronize your Gadget application's source
  code with your local filesystem.

  While ggt sync is running, local file changes are immediately
  reflected within Gadget, while files that are changed in Gadget are
  immediately saved to your local filesystem.

  Ideal for:
    • Local development with editors like VSCode
    • Storing source code in a Git repository like GitHub

  Sync looks for a \\".ignore\\" file to exclude certain files/directories
  from being synced. The format is identical to Git's.

  These files are always ignored:
    • .DS_Store
    • .gadget
    • .git
    • node_modules

  Note:
    • Sync only works with your development environment
    • Avoid deleting/moving all your files while sync is running
    • Gadget only supports Yarn v1 for dependency installation

  $ ggt sync ~/gadget/example --app example
