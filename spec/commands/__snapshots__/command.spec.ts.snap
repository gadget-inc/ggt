exports[`sync > has a usage 1`] = `
"Sync your Gadget application's source code to and from
your local filesystem.

USAGE
  ggt sync [DIRECTORY] [--app=<name>]

ARGUMENTS
  DIRECTORY         The directory to sync files to (default: \\".\\")

FLAGS
  -a, --app=<name>  The Gadget application to sync files to
      --force       Sync regardless of local file state

DESCRIPTION
  Sync allows you to synchronize your Gadget application's source
  code with your local filesystem.

  While ggt sync is running, local file changes are immediately
  reflected within Gadget, while files that are changed in Gadget are
  immediately saved to your local filesystem.

  Ideal for:
    • Local development with editors like VSCode
    • Storing source code in a Git repository like GitHub

  Sync looks for a \\".ignore\\" file to exclude certain files/directories
  from being synced. The format is identical to Git's.

  These files are always ignored:
    • .DS_Store
    • .gadget
    • .git
    • node_modules

  Note:
    • Sync only works with your development environment
    • Avoid deleting/moving all your files while sync is running
    • Gadget only supports Yarn v1 for dependency installation

EXAMPLE
  $ ggt sync ~/gadget/example --app example
