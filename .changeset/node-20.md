Require Node.js 20 or later.

Node.js 18 reached End-of-Life (EOL) on 2025-04-30:

- https://github.com/nodejs/release#end-of-life-releases
- https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/node-18-eol-support

This means Node.js 18 no longer receives security updates and bug fixes.

ggt runs on your computer, so it's important to use a supported version of Node to ensure you have the latest security updates. **Your Gadget environment will continue to use the Node version specified in your [Framework version](https://docs.gadget.dev/guides/gadget-framework).**
