Release v1.0.0

## `ggt` v1.0.0 is here!

We're excited to announce the release of `ggt` v1.0.0! This release is the culmination of months of hard work and includes a bunch of new commands to take advantage of Gadget's v1 launch week ðŸ‘€

Let's take a look at what's new:

### `ggt dev`

`ggt dev` replaces `ggt sync` and is the new and improved way to develop your Gadget app locally. It comes with a fresh new look and feel, making sure you always know which environment and git branch you're developing on.

That's right, `ggt dev` is git and multi-environment aware, and comes with a new `--env` flag to change which environment you're developing on.

> [!NOTE]
>
> `ggt sync` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. From now on, if you run `ggt sync`, `ggt dev` will be run instead.

### `ggt status`

Now that you can develop on multiple environments, it's important to know which environment you're currently developing on. That's where `ggt status` comes in. It shows you the current environment and git branch you're developing on, as well as the status of your local files compared to your environment's files.

### `ggt push` and `ggt pull`

When you need to push your local files to your environment, or pull your environment's files to your local machine without having ggt
continue to watch for changes, you can use `ggt push` and `ggt pull` respectively.

`ggt push` and `ggt pull` are also environment aware, so you can use the `--env` flag to specify which environment you want to push or pull from.

### `ggt deploy`

Once you're ready to deploy your environment to production, you can use `ggt deploy`. This command will ensure your environment's files are up to date with your local files, and then deploy your environment to production ðŸŽ‰

### `ggt open`

Finally, we've added `ggt open` to quickly open your Gadget app in your default browser. Run `ggt open --help` to see all the places you can open your browser to.

### This is just the beginning

Even though `ggt` v1.0.0 is here, we're not done yet. We have a lot of exciting features and improvements planned for the future. Don't be surprised to see a few v1.0.x releases in the coming days as we iron out any kinks the community finds ðŸ˜…

We hope you enjoy the new `ggt` commands and the new `ggt dev` experience. We're excited to see what you build with Gadget v1!
