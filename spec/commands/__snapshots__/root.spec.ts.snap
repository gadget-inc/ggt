"Adds models, fields, actions and routes to your app.

This command first performs a sync to ensure that your local and environment directories match, changes are tracked since last sync.
If any conflicts are detected, they must be resolved before adding models, fields, actions or routes.

Usage
  ggt add model <model_name> [field_name:field_type ...]

  ggt add action [CONTEXT]/<action_name>
  CONTEXT:Specifies the kind of action. Use "model" for model actions otherwise use "action".

  ggt add route <HTTP_METHOD> <route_path>

  ggt add field <model_path>/<field_name>:<field_type>

Options
  -e, --env <env_name> Selects the environment to add to. Default set on ".gadget/sync.json"

Examples
  Add a new model 'post' with out fields:
  $ ggt add model modelA

  Add a new model 'post' with 2 new 'string' type fields 'title' and 'body':
  $ ggt add model post title:string body:string

  Add new action 'publish' to the 'post' model:
  ggt add action model/post/publish

  Add a new action 'audit'
  ggt add action action/audit

  Add a new route 'howdy'
  ggt add route GET howdy

  Add a new 'boolean' type field 'published' to an existing model
  ggt add field post/published:boolean

"Clones your Gadget environment's files to your local machine and keeps it in sync, in order to

If your app's local directory already exists, this command first performs a sync to ensure

conflicts are detected, they must be resolved before development starts.

Usage
      $ ggt dev [DIRECTORY] [options]

      DIRECTORY: The directory to sync files to (default: the current directory)

Options
      -a, --app <app_name>        Selects the app to sync files with. Default set on ".gadget/sync.json"

Ignoring files
      ggt dev uses a .ignore file, similar to .gitignore, to exclude specific files and

Notes
      • "ggt dev" only works with development environments
      • "ggt dev" only supports "yarn" v1 for installing dependencies
      • Avoid deleting or moving all of your files while "ggt dev" is running

Examples
      sync an app in a custom path
      $ ggt dev ~/myGadgetApps/myBlog --app myBlogApp

      sync with a specific environment and preselect all local changes on conflicts
      $ ggt dev --env main --prefer local
