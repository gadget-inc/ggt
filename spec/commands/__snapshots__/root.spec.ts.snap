"Adds models, fields, actions and routes to your app.

This command first performs a sync to ensure that your local and environment directories match, changes are tracked since last sync.
If any conflicts are detected, they must be resolved before adding models, fields, actions or routes.

Usage
  ggt add model <model_name> [field_name:field_type ...]

  ggt add action [CONTEXT]/<action_name>
  CONTEXT:Specifies the kind of action. Use "model" for model actions otherwise use "action".

  ggt add route <HTTP_METHOD> <route_path>

  ggt add field <model_path>/<field_name>:<field_type>

Options
  -a, --app <app_name> Selects the app to add to. Defaults to the app synced to the current directory, if there is one.
  -e, --env <env_name> Selects the environment to add to. Defaults to the environment synced to the current directory, if there is one.

Examples
  Add a new model 'post' with out fields:
  $ ggt add model modelA

  Add a new model 'post' with 2 new 'string' type fields 'title' and 'body':
  $ ggt add model post title:string body:string

  Add a new 'boolean' type field 'published' to an existing model
  ggt add field post/published:boolean

  Add new action 'publish' to the 'post' model:
  ggt add action model/post/publish

  Add a new action 'audit'
  ggt add action action/audit
